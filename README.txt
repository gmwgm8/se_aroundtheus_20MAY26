Rough Description:

This project implemented adaptive tools to allow the website to adjust to three different screen sizes.
The desire was to smoothly transition from Desktop, Tablet to Mobile while shrinking the browser window. 
To accomplish this, we utilized the @mediaquery tool and specified the screen size limits for Tablet and Mobile only. 
This is because Desktop screen size is the default. We also utilized Grid instead of Flexbox to allow the cards of the same size
to fall into desired alignment and spacing. We used Figma for the first time in detecting the desired margins and spacing of website features within desktop
and mobile screen sizes, tablet spaces were more or less inherited from the desktop styles along with a bit of my own determinations. 
Using Figma I did encounter some issues with calling out too many margins and spaces, but tutors did help me to weed these out. 

Now in Sprint 4 we've begun implementing Javascript using the tools "Array" and "Object" which are on small display here. 
The start of responsive modal (pop-up form) to allow editing of the name and description of the around the world site. 
Also, a @mediaquery to modify this popup in a mobile screen size.

Javascipt was implemented to open and close the Responsive Modal used to edit the profile. In the final stage we've begun using javascript to prevent the page
from reloading upon clicking the save button in the modal as well beginning work on creating and editing new cards for the profile from a template.

Project 6:

Form validation for the Add New Card and create profile modals:

Prevents saving of profile or creation of cards unless character limitations for entries and ensuring that fields are not blank. 

Increasing user friendliness of modals by allowing them to close by pressing ESC or clicking outside modal planes. 

Project 7:

Refactoring and organization using Modules as opposed to using validator.js which was used as reference then discarded. Two modules or "components" were added, Card.js and FormValidator.js. The card module will handles all of the functionality required when interacting with cards deleting, creating, modifying, previewing, etc. FormValidator will do the same as validator.js, but will be significantly refactored using OOP principles, for example use of constructor and tying things into the module functionality using "this." which allows syntax to refer to itself instead of more cumbersome ways of attaching methods and functions. Also, we used Import and Export methodology to integrate Card and FormValidator modules into index.js. 

Finally, we slightly restructored our file structure getting rid of "scripts" and creating a "components" folder that would hold Card and FormValidator. The "Pages"folder now holds index.js and index.css. Again, validator.js becaume obsolete so then it was deleted. The rest of the project folder remained the same. 


Project 8:

Popup.js - Base popup class, no more manual modal functions 
PopupWithImage.js - Image preview popup, Correct inheritance and method override
PopupWithForm.js - Form popups (profile edit & add card), form handling with super calls
Section.js - Card rendering utility
UserInfo.js - User profile management

Use of webpack, babel js transpiler, postcss for either connecting different files, updating js scripts or css to older syntax automatically.
